Welcome to Drew's Euchre!

If you're unfamiliar with the game of Euchre, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euchre"Wikipedia has a detailed explaination</a>.
Since this website is created as a portfolio demo, you don't need to know the game well so included below is a condensed description of the game.

This web app is a demonstration only: since no one can hide their cards play would be pointless.
That said, this implementation is complete and accurate with thorough rules for card ranking and scoring.

For the real goods, please check out the <a href="https://github.com/adbenson/euchre">source code on GitHub.</a>

Enjoy!

Euchre
------
Euchre is a trick-taking card game with two teams of two players each.
Each player is dealt a "hand" of 5 cards and given the chance to declare which suit will be "trump" and beat all other suits.
Players then each play a card and the highest-ranking card played wins that "trick".
The team with the most tricks earns a point, and the first team to 10 points wins!
But there's a catch: if your team chose the trump suit and didn't win the most tricks,
then you've been "euchred" and your opponents get two points!

Euchre is around 200 years old and popular in the American midwest and around the world.


Here we see a table with four players randomly generated by the randomuser.me API.
The first dealer is chosen at random, click "Deal" to get started!

The first round of bidding has begun. Starting with the player to the left of the dealer,
each player in turn will have the chance to "order up" the card in the middle or pass to the next player.
If all players pass, the second round of bidding will begin.

The second round of bidding allows players to choose any trump suit except the one offered up previously.
That team's obligation to take the majority of tricks stays the same.

Having ordered up the card, the dealer picks up that card and discards another before play can begin.

With the trump suit established, the cards in each hand are reordered to put the higest value cards on top, with the remaining suits in traditional order: Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, then Hearts.

Starting with the player to the left of the dealer, each player plays one card.
The first card played each round can be any card in that players' hand.

The players after the first card are obligated to "follow suit" - if they have one or more cards of the same suit as the first, or "lead" card, 

Features:
- Created using React for components, Redux for state management, and intro.js for user guidance.
- Highly functional programming with totally immutable state
- Unit tests for all game rules
- Cards are dealt in the traditional manner (3-2-3-2-2-3-2-3) (this doesn't matter with a random shuffle but it was important to me.)
- Cards in the kitty and completed tricks are shown using a "mini card" with just rank and suit to save space.
- Cards automatically sort by trump, then traditional suit order, then rank including left and right bowers.
- Pleasing animated transitions on hover over valid cards.
- Player hands are displayd with cards splayed and overlapping, much as they would be in actual play.
- Automatic scoring at the end of each round with consideration for who ordered up trump and being euchred.
- Score cards displayed in the traditional format, with 4s and 6s overlapping so the number of pips showing indicates the team's score.
- Flashy post-game card waterfall with pseudo-3D rotation effect accomplished entirely through CSS.
- Fast-forward button (lower right corner) to automatically make next play to simplify demonstration.
